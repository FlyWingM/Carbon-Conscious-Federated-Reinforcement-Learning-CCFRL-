# Pioneering Eco-Efficiency in Cloud Computing: The Carbon-Conscious Federated Reinforcement Learning (CCFRL) Approach 🌍🤖  

## **About the Research**  
This repository hosts the **Accepted Manuscript** of my latest research published in the **IEEE Internet of Things Journal**.  

In this work, we introduce **Carbon-Conscious Federated Reinforcement Learning (CCFRL)**, a novel framework designed to optimize **carbon efficiency** and **model performance** simultaneously in **Federated Learning** (FL). By addressing challenges like **energy consumption**, **non-IID data distributions**, and **large-scale datasets**, this research paves the way for a sustainable and eco-efficient approach to cloud computing.

## **Key Highlights**  
- **Dynamic Optimization:** CCFRL uses reinforcement learning to adaptively allocate resources and clients in real-time.  
- **Energy & Carbon Efficiency:** Achieved up to **61.78% reduction in energy consumption** and **64.23% reduction in carbon emissions**.  
- **Scalable & Sustainable:** Demonstrates high performance across non-IID and large-scale datasets, promoting environmentally conscious AI.  
- **Advanced Techniques:** Includes entropy-based client allocation, adaptive exploration-exploitation strategies, and performance stagnation detection.
